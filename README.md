# Reed College CO2e Emission Analysis and Dashboard

## Abstract

This report seeks to understand a basic measure of students' carbon footprints and the consequent social cost of carbon at Reed College. We estimate that the average student’s carbon footprint is approximately 9.00 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, for a social cost of carbon of $459 - $1,665, using data on gas consumption, electrical usage, and travel information. Based on these findings, we recommend that Reed College institute a sustainability plan that brings more attention to how individuals’ consumptive behavior impacts their carbon footprint and to change policies to allow students to remain on campus during summer and winter breaks. As it can be challenging to ascertain student’s carbon footprints, due to the communal nature of university living, we also created an rShiny interactive dashboard where students can calculate their own carbon footprint using the data collected in this paper.
